## Overview

Early and accurate detection of diseases is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images into different classes of cancerous cells. We compare the performance of CNNs, ResNet, and Vision Transformers to identify the most effective architecture for this task.

## Dataset

We use the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, which comprises 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. The dataset is publicly available and includes labels relevant to cancer diagnosis.

1. Navigate to `data_download.ipynb` and download the data. Ensure that it is downloaded into `input` folder.
2. Delete downloaded zip if needed
3. Change the path in models. `image_dir` `root_dir` and `image_path`, otherwise where applicable.

To run it on smaller dataset. Navigate to:
